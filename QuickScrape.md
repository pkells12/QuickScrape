## Implementation Details

### Auto-Selection of Scraping Backends

The system will use these heuristics to choose backends:

1. **BeautifulSoup + Requests** (for simple static sites):
   - HTML doesn't contain significant JavaScript code
   - No infinite scroll or dynamic loading
   - No evidence of client-side rendering
   - No login forms or complex interactions needed

2. **Playwright** (for dynamic sites):
   - Significant JavaScript detected in source
   - Elements with event listeners for loading content
   - Single-page application frameworks detected
   - "Load more" buttons or infinite scroll patterns
   - Login forms or interactive elements required

The selection logic will:
1. Perform initial GET request to analyze page source
2. Check for JavaScript frameworks and dynamic patterns
3. Look for indicators like React/Angular/Vue mounting points
4. Detect load-more buttons, infinite scroll listeners
5. Default to BeautifulSoup unless dynamic content indicators found

### Claude API Error Handling

The Claude API client will implement this error handling strategy:

1. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Initial delay: 1 second
   - Backoff multiplier: 2
   - Maximum retries: 5
   - Maximum delay: 32 seconds
   - Jitter: 0-500ms random addition

2. **Error Categories**:
   - Authentication errors (invalid/expired API key)
   - Rate limiting (too many requests)
   - Server errors (500-level responses)
   - Timeout errors
   - Parsing errors (malformed responses)

3. **Response Handling**:
   - Success: Return parsed response
   - Retryable error: Apply backoff, retry
   - Terminal error: Clear error message, graceful fallback
   - API unavailable: Suggest alternative approaches

### Data Cleaning Pipeline

The cleaning pipeline will perform these operations in sequence:

1. **Text Normalization**:
   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace
   - Normalize internal whitespace (collapse multiple spaces)
   - Decode HTML entities (&amp; → &)
   - Remove HTML tags if present in content
   - Handle Unicode normalization

2. **Type Detection and Conversion**:
   - Numbers: Detect various formats, strip currency symbols
   - Dates: Recognize common formats, convert to ISO
   - Booleans: Recognize yes/no, true/false, 1/0 patterns
   - URLs: Validate and normalize
   - Email addresses: Validate format

3. **Structure Normalization**:
   - Convert nested structures to flat where appropriate
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions
   - Handle lists and tables with consistent format
   - Normalize empty values (None, empty string, etc.)

### Terminal-Based Wizard Interface

The terminal wizard will use these Rich library components:

1. **Panel** - For creating boxed sections of information
2. **Prompt** - For user input with validation
3. **Table** - For displaying structured data
4. **Syntax** - For showing HTML structure with syntax highlighting
5. **Progress** - For long-running operations
6. **Tree** - For displaying HTML element hierarchy

The wizard flow will include these steps:

1. Welcome screen with brief explanation
2. URL input with validation and connection testing
3. Page structure display with element selection
4. Data preview from selected elements
5. Pagination configuration if detected
6. Output format and location selection
7. Configuration summary and confirmation
8. Configuration saving with success message

## Progress Tracking

The project progress log will be updated at each milestone completion:

```
PROJECT STATUS: [Planning/Development/Testing/Release]
UPDATED: [DATE]
CURRENT MILESTONE: [Current focus area]
COMPLETED TASKS: [Count and list]
PENDING TASKS: [Next priorities]
BLOCKERS: [Any issues preventing progress]
NEXT ACTIONS: [Immediate next steps]
```

This systematic tracking will ensure development stays focused and that all team members are aware of the current project status and priorities.
